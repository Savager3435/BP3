Discord Bot for getting crypto-prices, if you just want to webscrape the prices from the command line look at the plain "BP3" File.  

Currently supports Bitcoin, and Etherum. Stellar and XRP are in an experimental stage.
Results are webscraped from Coindesk, and currently the way I have it setup it grabs the price once and then doesnt update it, a fix is being worked on. 

To trigger a command use the "$" prefix. Commands are NOT case sensitive.  

All of the commands are:

$info - displays information about the bot 

$supported - displays a list of the currently supported currencies 

$bitcoin - displays price of Bitcoin 

$eth/$etherum - displays price of Etherum 

$stellar - displays price of Stellar

$XPR - displays price of XPR


To come soon is 24 hour returns, and improved discord embeds.
